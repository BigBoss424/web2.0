# web2.0

This will be my new attempt separate from web1.0. I will be carrying over ideas from web1.0 to web2.0 as I further my web development skills.

Goals
- - - - -

To build my company site, and develop it using Firebase. Building smaller web applications and websites to better hone my skills as a web developer. I will be focusing on the core foundation of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript until I can get better acquainted with the stack and then move onto building applications with the LAMP stack.

I want to build my network on free hosting services for the time being until it becomes necessary for me to utilize anything other than Firebase. The reason why I am strickly using Firebase is because I host my businesses landing page on it. I will be learning more about microservices and utilizing third-party applications to build my IT infrastructure.

Imperatives

The goal is to become better acquainted with the languages and web stacks that I am utilizing. I will be using a variety of web services and I will be organizing them here in this Github repository until I find a better place to organize them.

I will be learning how to utilize Github Actions and cronjobs to better automate my workflow to become more efficient. As I struggle with keeping up with the daily tasks of managing all my repositories.

I will then learn how to utilize Google Ads and Google Cloud based services to provide me the services I need to run my business virtually and enable me to work with any client in the US and Global.
