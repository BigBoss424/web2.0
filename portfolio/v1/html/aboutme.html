            <p>
                My name is Aaron Jones, I reside in Altadena, California. I am a Web Developer and Programmer of sorts with experience in langauges such as Java, C, C++, HTML5, CSS3, RoR (Ruby on Rails). I also have experience managing servers and services such as Web Hosting and SEO Optimization. I enjoy using Linux and other Unix-Based Operating Systems. I have a great attention to detail and like to ensure that my clients are fully satisfied with the site or program that I build for them. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">How I Started My Programming Career</h2>
            <p>
                I started programming in High School at Glendale Adventist Academy (GAA), taking classes such as Web Design and Programming I and II. Which introduced me to languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the C programming language. I later went onto College at a variety of colleges which taught me the fundamentals of C++ and Java. I took it upon my self with the basic knowledge of those languages to expand into other langauges such as HTML5, CSS3, C#, and Ruby on Rails. I also began learning frameworks such as Node.js, Angular.js, and Bootstrap. I am always looking to learn new langauges and frameworks to be able to offer a variety of different solutions to potential clients.
